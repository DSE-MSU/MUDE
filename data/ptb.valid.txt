 <unk> members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts . 
 The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan <unk> ( D. , Ill. ) , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an <unk> bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . 
 The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . 
 `` Such agency ` <unk> ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. <unk> <unk> ( D. , Calif. ) , the bill 's chief sponsor . 
 The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ N billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC . 
 This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from <unk> the budget deficit . 
 Another $ N billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates . 
 But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately . 
 That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ N billion , or $ N billion including interest over N years . 
 `` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David <unk> , executive director of the RTC . 
 The agency has already spent roughly $ N billion selling N insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge N by the time the bailout concludes . 
 <unk> other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets . 
 `` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , '' he said . 
 The complicated language in the huge new law has <unk> the fight . 
 The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ N billion at any time . 
 Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ N billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and <unk> from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds . 
 But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's <unk> plan , and Rep. Charles <unk> ( D. , N.Y . ) said the RTC <unk> Board has been <unk> in not keeping Congress informed . 
 `` That <unk> leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of <unk> , '' he said . 
 `` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior <unk> on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . '' 
 The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday . 
 We 're about to see if advertising works . 
 <unk> on the heels of Friday 's N stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads <unk> a familiar message : <unk> on investing , the market 's just fine . 
 Their mission is to keep clients from <unk> the market , as individual investors did in <unk> after the crash in October 
 Just days after the N crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors . 
 This time around , they 're moving even faster . 
 PaineWebber Inc. <unk> a new television commercial at N p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . 
 Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today . 
 Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads . 
 It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday . 
 Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were <unk> out potential new ad strategies . 
 The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic . 
 This time , the firms were ready . 
 Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge . 
 When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers . 
 The ads <unk> Fidelity 's automated N beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . '' 
 A Fidelity spokesman says the N , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend . 
 `` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says . 
 `` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . 
 It would have been too late to think about on Friday . 
 We had to think about it ahead of time . '' 
 Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity . 
 <unk> the headline `` <unk> , '' it <unk> , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . '' 
 It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name . 
 PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the N crash . 
 In the aftermath of the N debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night . 
 It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute <unk> . 
 The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , <unk> particularly bullish . 
 <unk> just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... . 
 We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . '' 
 The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night . 
 PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks . 
 Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its <unk> to keep that money in the market . 
 `` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John <unk> , PaineWebber 's director of advertising . 
 `` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . '' 
 He adds , `` This is n't N <unk> . '' 
 With the market <unk> and then closing up more than N points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly <unk> their approach . 
 At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to <unk> yesterday afternoon . 
 The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's <unk> , black-and-white `` Where We <unk> '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since N . 
 The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` <unk> by <unk> . '' 
 But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad . 
 `` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . 
 The market seems to be <unk> out ; we 're taking a <unk> attitude , '' says <unk> B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing . 
 In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of N . 
 But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective . 
 In N , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en <unk> . 
 Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around . 
 Ad Notes ... .

 Edward <unk> , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee WCRS / Boston , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop . 
 Terms were n't disclosed . 
 Mr. <unk> , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold . 
 John <unk> , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president . 
 Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , <unk> <unk> , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ N million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area . 
 That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .

 A N ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate <unk> '' issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation 's education crisis . 
 The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from N corporate advertisers and <unk> off a two-year Business Week initiative on education . 
 The magazine will distribute N % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .

 It 's what N ) explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than <unk> Jackson ; N ) <unk> that it 's possible to <unk> in a <unk> that averages two feet deep ; and N ) predicts that N <unk> placed before N <unk> would produce N <unk> rock <unk> roll <unk> . 
 <unk> , that game of the long haul , is the <unk> sport of the mean , and the mean <unk> law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend . 
 The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago <unk> in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the <unk> Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done <unk> similarly by the Los Angeles <unk> and <unk> <unk> in last year 's <unk> . 
 <unk> , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do . 
 In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of <unk> autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's <unk> , Terry <unk> . 
 He hit a N pitch from <unk> <unk> into the <unk> stands in <unk> four to stretch his team 's lead from N to a <unk> N , where it stayed . 
 So what if <unk> had struck just seven home runs in N regular-season games , and <unk> in the seventh position of the A 's lineup . 
 `` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later <unk> . 
 On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold <unk> away successes to <unk> the pain of past and , no doubt , future <unk> . 
 Mark <unk> , the big , <unk> Oakland first <unk> , had three hits in four at <unk> , two more than he 'd had in the <unk> <unk> series in which he 'd gone N . 
 The <unk> <unk> <unk> N through N , <unk> the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's N hits and scored four of its runs in a N decision . 
 <unk> Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday <unk> . 
 That he was the A 's <unk> <unk> during its American League campaign with a N mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his <unk> <unk> is <unk> , that might not be this week . 
 The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who <unk> early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven <unk> in Sunday 's contest . 
 `` Every guy they put out there had a better <unk> than the guy before , '' <unk> Giant manager Roger Craig . 
 He 's an <unk> who 's one of the leading <unk> of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a <unk> until it <unk> beneath the <unk> <unk> . 
 The <unk> of the <unk> is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the <unk> <unk> . 
 The <unk> to <unk> with here says that about three of four clubs ( N of N ) that took N Series leads went on to win it all . 
 That 's not an average to <unk> Giant <unk> . 
 One might think that the home fans in this Series of the <unk> Called BART ( that 's a better name for a public <unk> than `` <unk> , '' do n't you think ? ) would have been <unk> over the proceedings , but they <unk> them in relative calm . 
 <unk> of the two <unk> sat side by side in the N seats of Oakland <unk> , and while they cheered their <unk> and <unk> the opposition , <unk> advanced no further , at least as far as I could see . 
 A few folks even showed up wearing <unk> bearing the colors and <unk> of both teams . 
 `` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday . 
 I love <unk> both . 
 The only thing I 'm <unk> for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento <unk> , at the <unk> before Sunday 's go . 
 The above represents a <unk> of either <unk> or <unk> . 
 I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably <unk> from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else . 
 <unk> it to say that if this were a New York <unk> series , or one between the Chicago <unk> and White <unk> ( <unk> , it 's possible ) , you 'd need <unk> police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the <unk> would <unk> their <unk> . 
 <unk> , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for . 
 In the opening game , besides <unk> and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> who had lost a couple months of the season to <unk> surgery . 
 He was <unk> <unk> ( <unk> in game two ) , moved a <unk> along in the A 's <unk> second <unk> , and <unk> for his team 's final <unk> . 
 Such is his reputation among the East Bay <unk> that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an <unk> . 
 Not his <unk> ; <unk> <unk> 's . 
 An A 's <unk> of the second game was <unk> Henderson , who <unk> the hot side of the <unk> equation . 
 He <unk> Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in N at <unk> , and continued that by going N at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and <unk> a run . 
 `` When you 're in the <unk> , you see every ball <unk> , '' he <unk> . 
 The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and <unk> Williams , the Giants ' N <unk> . 
 They combined for N hits , six home runs and N runs <unk> in in the five games against the <unk> . 
 They went a collective N here , with zero <unk> and <unk> . 
 It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come . 
 `` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco <unk> coach <unk> Baker after game two . 
 `` I 'd rather see a <unk> <unk> who 's hot come up for the other side than a good <unk> who 's cold . '' 
 But the old <unk> <unk> <unk> offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side . 
 `` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said .

 NCR Corp. reported a N % drop in third-quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip . 
 Net income for the quarter fell to $ N million from $ N million , roughly what analysts had expected . 
 But per-share profit dropped only N % to $ N a share from $ N a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan . 
 Average shares outstanding dropped to N million from N million . 
 Revenue fell N % to $ N billion from $ N billion . 
 The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` <unk> affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better N results . 
 NCR said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets . 
 The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter . 
 Analysts estimate those gains at N % to N % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers . 
 In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated <unk> machines and computerized cash <unk> , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes <unk> G. <unk> , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc . 
 These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should <unk> affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said . 
 In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ N million , or $ N a share , on revenue of $ N billion . 
 Mr. <unk> said he lowered his full-year estimates for N to $ N a share from $ N a share . 
 Revenue projections were slashed to $ N billion from $ N billion . 
 Last year , NCR had net income of $ N million , or $ N a share , on $ N billion in revenue . 
 For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell N % to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or $ N a share . 
 <unk> declined N % to $ N billion from $ N billion . 
 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell N cents to close at $ N . 
 <unk> your Sept. N article `` Wall Street Firms <unk> Analysts ' <unk> to <unk> , '' I 'm delighted that Wall Street is finally <unk> in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world . 
 If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , <unk> analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ? 
 Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ? 
 That should stop a lot of <unk> , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense . 
 Now , would n't that be a <unk> .

 Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at N a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting . 
 At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis <unk> did n't reach the office until N a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home .

 `` I was <unk> up every hour -- N , N , N , N .

 For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours . 
 By <unk> , the selling was at <unk> fever . 
 But as the day ended in a <unk> Wall <unk> rally , the City <unk> a <unk> of relief . 
 So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London 's financial district . 
 In the wake of Wall Street 's plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable . 
 And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a <unk> as to how widespread the fallout might be . 
 By the time trading officially got under way at N a.m. , the news from Asia was in . 
 And it left mixed signals for London . 
 Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but <unk> N % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined N % in orderly trading . 
 At Jefferies ' trading room on <unk> Circus , a <unk> circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market 's major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange N Share Index . 
 Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks . 
 Right away , the <unk> outnumbered the <unk> , N to N , as the index opened at N , off N points , or N % . 
 `` I see concern , but I do n't see any panic , '' said Mr. <unk> , a big , <unk> New York native who runs the N office . 
 The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it <unk> , seeking to avoid risk . 
 `` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks . 
 `` We tend to run a very tight book . '' 
 Jefferies spent most of its <unk> in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n't many buyers . 
 `` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & <unk> , B.A.T , <unk> -- are getting pretty well <unk> this morning , '' Mr. Smith said . 
 <unk> later , a N `` sell '' order for Scottish & <unk> came in . 
 For the third time in N minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the <unk> area to have a cigarette . 
 On the screens , only two <unk> blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about N . 
 `` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said . 
 He targeted N shares of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes . 
 The vivid yellow figures showed the best price at N pence , ( $ N ) and Mr. Smith 's traders started putting out <unk> . 
 But the market <unk> a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to N pence . 
 `` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said . 
 `` It 's very <unk> . '' 
 He temporarily abandoned his search for the <unk> shares . 
 By this time , it was N a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith <unk> a call from a New York customer wanting an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday 's New York market break . 
 `` <unk> dangerous ... , '' Mr. Smith said , almost in a <unk> , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely <unk> poised ... 
 we 're in for a lot of turbulence ... . '' 
 He was right . 
 By midday , the London market was in full retreat . 
 `` It 's falling like a <unk> , '' said <unk> <unk> , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange . 
 Only half the usual <unk> crowd gathered at the tony <unk> & <unk> wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby . 
 <unk> was <unk> as most <unk> watched the latest market statistics on television . 
 At N p.m. , the index hit its low , N , off N points . 
 `` France opened the limit down , off at least N % if you could <unk> the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon . 
 `` Spain is down N % and suspended , Sweden 's down N % , Norway N % . 
 This market has been very badly damaged . '' 
 As N p.m. -- Wall Street 's opening time -- <unk> , Shearson traders and salesmen traded bets on how low the New York market would open . 
 In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger <unk> and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- <unk> more than N points in the first few minutes . 
 They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off . 
 As Wall Street traders dumped American <unk> <unk> in Jaguar PLC , Mr. <unk> and trader Sam <unk> bought them to <unk> in the <unk> . 
 Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar . 
 Suddenly , after about N minutes , the U.S. markets rallied . 
 `` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted one trader at about N London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a <unk> . 
 As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild . 
 Traders shouted as their screens posted an <unk> loss on Wall Street . 
 Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . 
 `` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! '' shouted Shearson trader <unk> Rosen , selling more Jaguar shares . 
 `` This is panic buying ! '' 
 As the London market rallied , some <unk> whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it . 
 The London index closed at N , its high for the day , off N , or about N % . 
 Ambassador Paul <unk> 's statement ( <unk> & <unk> , Sept. N ) , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things . 
 Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ? 
 Do n't be such a <unk> , Mr. Ambassador . 
 Frank <unk> 
 The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines . 
 The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday . 
 The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged . 
 The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a <unk> shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines . 
 In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James <unk> ( D. , Minn. ) , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal . 
 <unk> <unk> , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration 's opposition to the bill `` in its present form . '' 
 Rep. <unk> brushed off Mr. Trump 's allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . '' 
 He also said the fact that the other letter had n't come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` <unk> room '' in the administration 's position . 
 Mr. <unk> and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n't a response to any particular market situation . 
 But they cited the UAL and AMR <unk> as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation . 
 <unk> both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to <unk> efforts to push the legislation . 
 `` It 's still on the fast track and we still want to do it , '' said one Senate aide . 
 The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out . 
 Currently , the transportation secretary does n't have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the <unk> step of <unk> the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers <unk> . 
 <unk> of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and <unk> to the <unk> process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry . 
 In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a N review period before N % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired . 
 It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition . 
 The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n't been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest . 
 If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period N days . 
 All the witnesses , both congressmen and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent <unk> from <unk> in on airline profits at the expense of safe , <unk> service . 
 But several committee members <unk> , some backing Mr. Trump 's claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge . 
 One of the major concerns expressed by the dissenters was that large airlines would be prohibited from <unk> themselves of smaller entities and producing independent <unk> companies . 
 In a possible prelude to the <unk> of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow . 
 `` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , '' said Doug Hammond , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a <unk> of negotiations . 
 `` We 're encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , '' a Boeing spokesman said . 
 The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a N % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses . 
 Currently , average pay for machinists is $ N an hour , Boeing said . 
 Now in its N day , the strike has <unk> about N machinists and has started to delay delivery of some <unk> . 
 With a strike fund of about $ N million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike . 
 After the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ N a week from the fund . 
 Work at Boeing continues with supervisors and other <unk> personnel <unk> the lines . 
 And at the company 's <unk> , Kan. , plant , about N of the N machinists still are working , Boeing said . 
 Under Kansas <unk> laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members . 
 Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant <unk> , Wash. , plant . 
 Union officials could n't be reached for comment . 
 DPC Acquisition Partners , a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp. , said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker 's common stock . 
 DPC , a group led by the New York investment firm <unk> Inc. , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ' board . 
 DPC holds a N % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ N bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ N million proposal unacceptable . 
 A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group 's new plan . 
 In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Dataproducts shares jumped N cents to close at $ N . 
 Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block . 
 The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary . 
 As part of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ N million of its real estate holdings to <unk> <unk> Inc. , a unit of Canada 's <unk> Corp . 
 Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . '' 
 He called today 's announcement `` <unk> and <unk> '' and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring . 
 Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday 's New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another rout . 
 European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound . 
 The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which closed before the New York exchanges opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping N % . 
 In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as N % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only N % . 
 West German Economics Minister Helmut <unk> said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly . 
 There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based on fundamentals . 
 The economy of West Germany and the EC { European Community } is highly stable . '' 
 Paris , which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit . 
 Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm . 
 Prices in Brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled . 
 Following is a breakdown of major market activity : 
 <unk> : 
 One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy . 
 The DAX Index of N West German blue chips plunged N % , a one-day record , <unk> out the summer 's gains . 
 The index closed at N , down N points . 
 By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped N % , according to a projection by the exchange . 
 Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had vivid memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing N % of its value in the N crash and its wake . 
 This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly . 
 `` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said Andreas <unk> , an investment adviser for the Bank in <unk> 's Frankfurt branch . 
 He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about N % . 
 After the opening was delayed N minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal <unk> trading session was extended N minutes to handle the heavy volume . 
 `` The beginning was <unk> , '' said Nigel <unk> , a broker for Commerzbank AG . 
 `` It took <unk> of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . '' 
 Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild N % decline in Tokyo stock prices . 
 `` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors . 
 That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , '' said <unk> <unk> , a senior trader for <unk> <unk> . 
 Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up <unk> shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting . 
 But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a N high of N on Sept. N . 
 Some of West Germany 's <unk> chips took some of the biggest hits . 
 A N % drop for <unk> AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's N % decline were especially problematic for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in <unk> . 
 Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise N billion marks ( $ N million ) by issuing four million shares at N marks each . 
 Yet yesterday 's market <unk> Dresdner 's share price by N marks to N marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market <unk> quickly .

 When Wall Street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking for bargains . 
 J.P. Morgan & Co. <unk> to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp. reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose N % . 
 J.P. Morgan & Co . 
 J.P. Morgan , as expected , posted a $ N billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank 's decision last month to add $ N billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries . 
 The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves . 
 The latest quarter 's loss <unk> $ N a share . 
 In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ N million , or $ N a share . 
 George M. <unk> , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` mildly disappointing . '' 
 Excluding the $ N billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about N cents a share , Mr. <unk> said . 
 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ N a share to $ N . 
 Net interest income sank N % in the quarter to $ N million from $ N million . 
 The interest rate on short-term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said . 
 Morgan received $ N million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been <unk> interest , net interest income would have been $ N million higher in the quarter , Morgan said . 
 Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as <unk> , costing the bank $ N million of interest income in the third period . 
 Income from sources other than interest climbed N % to $ N million , reflecting higher <unk> and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities . 
 `` These increases were partly offset by lower <unk> '' income , the bank said . 
 <unk> expenses grew N % to $ N million . 
 NCNB Corp . 
 NCNB Corp. 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations . 
 The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or N cents a share , a year earlier . 
 The latest quarter included a gain of $ N million , or N cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining N % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . 
 The strong performance , however , <unk> with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast . 
 In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ N million , or N % of net loans and leases , from $ N million , or N % in the second quarter . 
 <unk> totaled $ N million , or N % in the year-ago third quarter . 
 <unk> in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ N million loan , which NCNB said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . '' 
 The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of N % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a N % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign . 
 The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to N % from N % a year earlier . 
 In Big Board composite trading yesterday , NCNB jumped $ N a share , to $ N . 
 Results were released after the market closed . 
 NCNB Texas National , formed from the <unk> of of the failed First <unk> Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ N million to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter . 
 NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect N % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. N . 
 NCNB raised some $ N billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise . 
 Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ N million . 
 In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed N % to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or $ N a share , a year earlier . 
 Security Pacific Corp . 
 Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a N % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans . 
 Net rose to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or $ N a share , a year earlier . 
 The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ N million increase in net interest income , reflecting a N % increase in real estate loans ( mainly residential ) , and a N % rise in consumer loans . 
 These <unk> loans in effect replaced some <unk> assets such as <unk> loans , which were allowed to decrease . 
 As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only N basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings . 
 Security Pacific shares closed at $ N , down N cents , in Big Board composite trading . 
 The earnings represent a N % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an N % return on equity . 
 The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market . 
 Security Pacific reported a N % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ N million from $ N million in the year-ago period . 
 <unk> loans grew slightly to $ N billion at Sept. N , from $ N billion a year ago . 
 Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down N % , or $ N million , because it added to its <unk> reserve the year before . 
 <unk> income fell N % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations . 
 <unk> expense grew only N % in the period . 
 For the nine months , net rose N % to $ N million , or $ N a share , from $ N million , or $ N a share , a year earlier . 
 LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for <unk> of the offer . 
 The new offer , which seeks N % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ N a share for N million LIN shares . 
 McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN . 
 LIN is asking McCaw to <unk> its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their <unk> businesses . 
 BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is <unk> . '' 
 The LIN board said holders may be <unk> by the provision in the McCaw proposal that `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares . 
 McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said . 
 The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could <unk> its private market value and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in five years . '' 
 In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ N , down $ N . 
 A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. 's $ N offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . '' 
 In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which holds about N million Telerate shares , or about N % of the shares outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ N per share would be fair and some believe that $ N is too low . '' 
 The letter was dated Oct. N . 
 In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed yesterday at $ N , down N cents a share . 
 Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an $ N , or $ N million , tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns N % of Telerate . 
 Telerate has rejected the offer , which expires Nov. N . 
 The group includes <unk> Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston ; Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco ; the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. , and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore . 
 Among other issues , the group 's letter said it has `` concerns as to whether Dow Jones 's offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness . '' 
 A spokesman for Dow Jones said he had n't seen the group 's filing , but added , `` obviously Dow Jones <unk> with their conclusions . 
 Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ N a share . 
 U.S. Trade <unk> <unk> Hills said the first <unk> panel set up under the <unk> `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific <unk> and <unk> violate the accord . 
 Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. N to resolve the dispute . 
 If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. <unk> companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest . 
 However , in <unk> , Canadian Trade Minister John <unk> said the <unk> panel accepted the `` <unk> of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to <unk> and manage these important <unk> . '' 
 <unk> about the <unk> <unk> in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . '' 
 The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions . 
 Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought <unk> in British Columbia by commercial <unk> prior to export . 
 This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds . 
 Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the <unk> panel rejected this Canadian government argument . 
 `` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended , she said . 
 Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on <unk> and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian <unk> restrictions violated GATT rules . 
 Mrs. Hills said the U.S. wo n't accept any delays after Nov. N because U.S. <unk> firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch . 
 She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .

 BSN said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value .

 At Merrill Lynch , <unk> net was $ N million , or N cents a share , down from $ N million , or N cents a share , a year ago .

 The market upheaval apparently has n't triggered any cash crunch -- yet . 
 Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans . 
 But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties . 
 `` We 're seeing nothing out of the ordinary , '' said one official at a <unk> N bank . 
 `` That 's good news , because we all <unk> in this water . '' 
 <unk> another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little <unk> over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen { Monday } , but it 's been very quiet . 
 Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who knows ? 
 What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently <unk> to handle another <unk> in prices . 
 No <unk> with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . 
 But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . 
 After the N plunge , markets agreed that it would be <unk> to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose . 
 The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls N points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits N points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . 
 The <unk> is that an <unk> of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . 
 It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . 
 A temporary <unk> of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from <unk> on itself . 
 But there is also the possibility that <unk> down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices . 
 What happened Friday was the worst of all <unk> . 
 The futures exchanges followed their own <unk> circuit breakers and shut down at about N p.m. for N minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's N stock index had fallen N points , or about N points on the Dow Jones index . 
 Options markets stopped trading in many securities . 
 The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open . 
 With <unk> else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange . 
 As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply . 
 Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . 
 At N , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened . 
 Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at N , after the futures markets had dropped an additional N points , which is the daily limit for price declines . 
 At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange . 
 It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though <unk> separate , have actually become so closely <unk> as to constitute one market effectively . 
 Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . 
 It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers . 
 To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . 
 <unk> circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for <unk> , less volatile executions . 
 It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for <unk> trading or staying open . 
 Let 's not have one market shut down for N minutes when the Dow declines N points and another shut down for an hour after a N decline . 
 The need for <unk> last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that <unk> circuit breakers in all markets . 
 The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . 
 The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . 
 Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , <unk> the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary . 
 In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago . 
 The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day . 
 Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the <unk> of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions .

 `` It 's a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . '' 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> In Environmental <unk> 
 <unk> 'S a retailer that 's getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products . 
 Big Bear <unk> Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute <unk> recommending products deemed safe for the environment . 
 The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health <unk> and will include products like Murphy 's Oil <unk> and other <unk> <unk> . 
 But the chain is quickly <unk> the <unk> of such <unk> . 
 For example , it recommends <unk> <unk> detergent and puts <unk> on its environmentally safe list . 
 That does n't <unk> Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of <unk> <unk> detergent . 
 A company spokesman questioned the <unk> of the list , noting that <unk> is present in all major <unk> <unk> . 
 In fact , <unk> Bros. confirms that its <unk> brand does contain <unk> <unk> , even though it is n't listed on the label for the <unk> version . 
 Thomas G. <unk> , Big Bear 's executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems . 
 `` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , '' he says . 
 `` And it 's important that we be accurate . '' 
 But in the end , customers ' wishes are what will prevail . 
 Big Bear does n't care for disposable <unk> , which are n't <unk> . 
 Yet parents demand them . 
 Says Mr. <unk> , `` We 'll still be forced to sell items we might not <unk> agree with . '' 
 Odds and Ends 
 <unk> does count -- at least in the grocery store . 
 A study by <unk> 's <unk> Marketing Research shows soap sales climbed N % when bars were neatly <unk> on shelves instead of dumped in a wire basket ... . 
 Which <unk> <unk> are most <unk> ? 
 For the third year in a row , consumers voted Bill <unk> first and James <unk> second in <unk> as spokesmen in TV commercials , according to Video <unk> <unk> , New York . 
 Michael J. Fox replaced Bruce <unk> in third place ; <unk> placed fourth for the second time . 
 Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan has chosen <unk> <unk> to be the next <unk> general , Bush administration officials said . 
 If she is <unk> by President Bush and confirmed by the Senate , Dr. <unk> would succeed C. <unk> <unk> , who rattled liberals and conservatives alike with his outspoken views on a range of health issues . 
 Dr. <unk> , an expert on <unk> kidney diseases , is deputy director of the National Institute of <unk> Health and Human Development . 
 She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome . 
 Dr. <unk> 's office said she would n't talk with reporters , and it refused to release any information about her . 
 The newsletter Medicine & Health , which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan , said she is N years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine . 
 The continuing series of HUD scandals is a <unk> predictable result of pork-barrel politics . 
 Nevertheless , <unk> such as the National Association of Home <unk> ( NAHB ) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending . 
 <unk> <unk> , NAHB executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a <unk> housing crisis -- reduced <unk> of homes for <unk> buyers , increased <unk> , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . '' 
 There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending . 
 But the NAHB was created in N out of an organization that made its name fighting a <unk> administration proposal to take over all defense housing production . 
 Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer 's coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the <unk> amendment . 
 Yet on matters close to , <unk> , home ... 
 `` The HUD budget has dropped by more than N % since N , '' argues Mr. <unk> . 
 `` We 've taken more than our fair share . 
 I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . '' 
 But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs . 
 It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced <unk> housing measures . 
 Moreover , explains one HUD official , the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production . 
 The association is pushing an extensive and expensive <unk> , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ N billion annually . 
 It would like to <unk> the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to N % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ N ; reduce ( or even eliminate ) FHA <unk> requirements and increase the availability of <unk> mortgages ; expand the Veterans Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration ( <unk> ) ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ N billion in block grants to states and <unk> ; and `` fully fund '' the <unk> Act , a $ N million <unk> for the homeless . 
 Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved <unk> expensive in the past , and inevitably are <unk> to the benefit of <unk> developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . 
 <unk> subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better . 
 Though Mr. <unk> says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere <unk> of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing ( such as low-income ) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense . 
 More important , housing programs run by HUD , the <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> in red ink . 
 The FHA alone lost $ N billion in fiscal N ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ N billion . 
 The federal government has had to pump in $ N billion into the <unk> housing program since N to keep the fund <unk> and the <unk> requested an additional $ N million for the fiscal year just ended . 
 All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ N billion of mortgages . 
 In its <unk> produced publication `` Where Will Our Children <unk> ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing <unk> can not be provided by the federal government . '' 
 It points to the <unk> impact of local government regulation , particularly <unk> and building fees , which <unk> the price of housing out of the reach of <unk> and <unk> people . 
 But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and <unk> should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate <unk> controls . 
 The association , a majority of whose N members build fewer than N units a year , is like many other business <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> MacDonald of the National <unk> Union : `` It <unk> in two <unk> . 
 The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the <unk> amendment . '' 
 Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . 
 Two years ago when the NAHB <unk> for the $ N billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ' coalition , '' says Ms. MacDonald . 
 As Mr. <unk> of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . 
 The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . '' 
 More money for HUD will increase the deficit and <unk> the economy ; more money to <unk> that are <unk> their local housing markets will further <unk> them from the <unk> effects of their policies . 
 Is this what the home builders want ?

 In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on <unk> the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome . 
 According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of N , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in <unk> , France , on Dec. N and N . 
 The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency . 
 But the process of <unk> the <unk> conference does n't require <unk> . 
 <unk> a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push . 
 French President <unk> Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was <unk> because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .

 When asked `` What went wrong ? '' the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . '' 
 And so it was on Gray Friday . 
 The grand <unk> of this <unk> would appear to have been excess leverage . 
 Even if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been <unk> to stop the <unk> before the end of the rout ( <unk> ) . 
 The <unk> began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing . 
 Although the <unk> expects to <unk> together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the <unk> of <unk> takeover deals is ending . 
 <unk> of other <unk> made up the <unk> , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , <unk> Federal Reserve <unk> ; and the Bush administration 's ( temporary ? ) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax . 
 As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that <unk> <unk> band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write . 
 What really spooked the <unk> along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is <unk> up . 
 Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly <unk> investments in the `` deal '' stocks are <unk> by the unexpected <unk> up of the <unk> for deal financing . 
 Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . 
 UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ N , down about N % from Thursday 's close . 
 AMR opened Monday at $ N , down nearly N % from Thursday 's close . 
 ( Both took further hits yesterday . ) 
 Hilton lost N % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost N % . 
 A careful look <unk> that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday . 
 The multibillion-dollar prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and / or issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated . 
 The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks . 
 The growing financial difficulties of recent <unk> <unk> or takeovers , such as <unk> International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities . 
 Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio <unk> and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring . 
 As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ N billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times . 
 These are all market excesses ( putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity ) , and what we 've seen is the market <unk> them in . 
 Of course , Washington had n't been <unk> in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to <unk> in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't <unk> us from the basic market <unk> that was at work on Friday . 
 If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ? 
 After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the <unk> direction of regulators . 
 Is this a case where private markets are <unk> of Washington 's <unk> of Wall Street ? 
 <unk> not . 
 To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden <unk> of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . 
 The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged <unk> . 
 The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the <unk> of bank capital for recent deals <unk> the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . 
 If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO <unk> become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with <unk> speed to impose appropriate sanctions . 
 Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they <unk> the <unk> up all year . 
 Not surprisingly , he sometimes <unk> . 
 The arbitragers and takeover <unk> got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered <unk> . 
 If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that <unk> and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington . 
 If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated . 
 The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics . 
 Although the average citizen is probably not <unk> too much from Washington 's <unk> war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial <unk> , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . 
 Any such attempt to distinguish `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . 
 Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them <unk> that seem never to end .

 Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of N selected stocks rising N points to close the morning session at N . 
 The index slid N points , or N % , on Monday . 
 In the first N minutes of Tuesday 's trading the Nikkei index soared N points , to N . 
 By N a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up N points , to N as investors hailed New York 's overnight rally . 
 Monday 's slide came in a relatively calm session that did n't provide much direction for other markets . 
 Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York . 
 Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of <unk> another market crash . 
 All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday 's N plunge on Wall Street . 
 But rather than set the tone for other markets , Japan 's major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines . 
 Still , despite the sudden <unk> of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n't planning to unload U.S. or European equities . 
 `` We did n't trade much today , as our policy now is to wait and see , '' said a fund manager at <unk> Life Insurance Co . 
 `` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . '' 
 The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure orderly trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that . 
 But in the absence of <unk> trading , its presence was never <unk> felt . 
 At the close , the Nikkei average of N stocks stood at N , down N points , or N % . 
 The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank N , or N % , to N . 
 The day 's decline was generally in line with analysts ' weekend predictions . 
 Declining issues swamped advancers , N . 
 But volume was thin at N million shares , compared with N million Friday . 
 The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly N after N minutes . 
 A <unk> rebound brought it back to show a gain of about N at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day 's low . 
 The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market 's second section also posted their biggest decline of the year . 
 The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell N , or N % , to N . 
 Many investors , trying to outperform the market 's major indexes , have flocked to these small issues in recent weeks . 
 Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n't fall more sharply . 
 But its performance did bear some resemblance to events of two years ago , during the October N global stock market crash . 
 On Oct. N , N -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped N % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a N % drop . 
 This time , Wall Street 's plunge of N % Friday was followed by yesterday 's N % loss in Tokyo . 
 Two years ago , Tokyo 's biggest fall came the day after New York 's N % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell N % . 
 Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead nervously to Wall Street 's opening . 
 But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged N to close at N on heavy volume of N shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market . 
 <unk> <unk> , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday 's session `` a good scenario '' for Japan . 
 `` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , '' he said . 
 `` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . '' 
 <unk> <unk> , general manager of the investment research department at <unk> Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic . 
 He described Friday 's plunge in the U.S. as a `` <unk> '' event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity . 
 `` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case two years ago , '' he said . 
 `` Those shares which had posted gains on <unk> speculation were dashed with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n't much impact . '' 
 Other fund managers were similarly <unk> . 
 `` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , '' said <unk> <unk> , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at <unk> Trust & Banking Co . 
 He said Friday 's Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility '' that <unk> Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy . 
 Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling N % and Singapore 's <unk> Times Industrial Index down N % . 
 Major indexes declined more than N % in Australia and New Zealand and N % in Hong Kong . 
 <unk> , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and <unk> escaped with slightly smaller losses . 
 Brokers and fund managers said the region 's markets were reacting to Friday 's Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market . 
 `` It 's pure psychology , '' said William <unk> <unk> , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert ( <unk> ) Ltd. in Hong Kong . 
 `` Markets in this region are n't so <unk> to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there 's no doubt that Asia is still following America 's lead . '' 
 Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows . 
 Hong Kong is the region 's next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China . 
 `` Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with <unk> Securities ( Hong Kong ) Ltd . 
 She pointed out that even after Monday 's N % decline , the <unk> Times index is up N % this year , so investors who <unk> out generally did so <unk> . 
 Similarly , Kuala Lumpur 's composite index yesterday ended N % above its N close . 
 In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell N to finish at N . 
 Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with N million Friday . 
 But the session was orderly , in contrast to the market 's four-day <unk> after the N crash . 
 Richard <unk> , a director at Hong <unk> <unk> International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close . 
 `` If New York does n't collapse , I see maybe another N % on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of China , '' he said . 
 In Australia , Sydney 's All <unk> index closed at N , down N % , its biggest drop since October N . 
 But volume rose only to N million shares from N million Friday . 
 <unk> <unk> , an analyst at brokerage firm <unk> , <unk> & Young Ltd. , described the market 's performance as `` <unk> '' as investors fled to <unk> Australian stocks and <unk> <unk> companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price . 
 London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange N index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of N , down N , or N % . 
 At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than N points . 
 The Financial Times N index closed N points lower at N . 
 Volume more than doubled to N million shares from N million Friday . 
 Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading . 
 The decline in the German Stock Index of N points , or N % , to N was the Frankfurt market 's <unk> fall ever . 
 <unk> investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as N % . 
 Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline <unk> for the next three months . 
 Here are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva . 
 To make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of N equaling N . 
 The percentage change is since year-end . 
 Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you <unk> the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California . 
 We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's <unk> , but maybe the state 's <unk> <unk> are starting to <unk> the forces that made it such a significant place . 
 What else is one to make of the <unk> <unk> initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state 's attorney general ? 
 If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by N % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to <unk> the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ N million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too <unk> . 
 The initiative is based largely on the <unk> of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of <unk> <unk> , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National <unk> <unk> and the Citizens for a Better <unk> . 
 <unk> , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one . 
 Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed . 
 The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards . 
 Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market . 
 In other words , California is <unk> to take control of the nation 's farm policy . 
 As usual the green lobby 's proposal is <unk> from scientific reality . 
 Consider the <unk> provision . 
 The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of N % . 
 Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is <unk> that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem . 
 But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ? 
 The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit . 
 The key here is the <unk> of state Attorney General John Van de <unk> . 
 He 's running for governor . 
 Mr. Van de <unk> is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and <unk> them into a single <unk> initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. N , N . 
 That 's also the day of the <unk> election . 
 The initiative seems to have been <unk> to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood <unk> who <unk> money . 
 And it allows Mr. Van de <unk> to get around campaign spending limits . 
 He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de <unk> initiative ( on which there are no limits ) is <unk> . 
 This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big <unk> . 
 ( The Republican candidate , Sen. Pete Wilson , is playing the initiative <unk> game too , <unk> his own crime initiative . ) 
 While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course <unk> that in modern California it could slide through . 
 This is the state that recently passed the <unk> N <unk> initiative . 
 If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly . 
 The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like . 
 That means the <unk> and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost . 
 Mr. Van de <unk> and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a <unk> and <unk> issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of <unk> , <unk> <unk> can pass under its <unk> . 
 Of course the state 's liberals are not yet a nation <unk> themselves . 
 George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n't want to be the President who lost control of interstate <unk> to an attorney general from California . 
 And some other segments of California 's political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state 's less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs . 
 This <unk> initiative will help California <unk> itself for the future either as a state still <unk> to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to wherever its <unk> activists want to take it . 
 First , there was a death watch . 
 Then <unk> . 
 <unk> by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's N plunge , gaining N to N . 
 It was the <unk> advance for the average of N blue chips , on <unk> New York Stock Exchange volume of N shares -- the highest since the days after the N crash . 
 While the advance cheered investors who feared a N crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a <unk> rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . 
 A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , N to N , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge . 
 The Nasdaq OTC index closed down N to N . 
 Meanwhile , in a <unk> in two of the market 's most important indicators , the Dow industrials ' sister average , the N Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled N to N -- its <unk> decline next to the N fall during the N crash . 
 <unk> plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than N % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon . 
 UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday 's N market plunge , fell N N to N N on nearly N million shares . 
 Overall , `` this is a <unk> rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur <unk> Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board . 
 `` Everyone was a little concerned about the general <unk> of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory . 
 It 's just a strange feeling . 
 I do n't think anyone left the place <unk> <unk> . '' 
 The rally gave <unk> , at least for now , to the <unk> declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday 's market debacle was `` an <unk> condition , and not a disaster . '' 
 But to traders , it looked like disaster on the N a.m. opening bell . 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down N shortly after N . 
 But most of the N blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday 's <unk> rout . 
 At N , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow <unk> of late -- opened down N N to N . 
 The Dow dropped to a quick N loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble . 
 More stocks opened over the <unk> half hour , as the N Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly <unk> to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood . 
 Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , <unk> stocks into <unk> losses . 
 There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets . 
 This was a <unk> from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's N index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks . 
 The <unk> of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized . 
 They did n't . 
 The Dow accelerated its slide , losing N in the first N minutes of trading . 
 With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall . 
 Then at N the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <unk> fall . 
 And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible . 
 All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily . 
 The program traders were in there , too , of course . 
 But according to one trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was { also } a lot of bargain-hunting '' by institutions . 
 <unk> M. <unk> , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ N billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning . 
 `` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take another $ N million and put it in '' the market . 
 Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes . 
 According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest <unk> imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n't finish trading that day . 
 The stock opened late at N N , down N N . 
 But then it shot upward N N as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said . 
 However , Disney specialist Robert <unk> said : `` I would be surprised if Goldman represented N % of the opening volume . '' 
 <unk> Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock . 
 At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader <unk> <unk> said : `` I think the opening was <unk> . 
 It was orderly . 
 We put some orders together . 
 There was n't a lot of panic selling , either <unk> or internationally ... . 
 Not like Friday where they just took { the market } apart . '' 
 Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were <unk> . 
 But in another dramatic burst , the Dow tacked on N points in five minutes , and at N the index showed a gain of N . 
 On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders <unk> their approval . 
 <unk> <unk> Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . '' 
 <unk> him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of <unk> water to cool them off . 
 Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` <unk> your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . 
 `` It was <unk> on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . 
 But not everybody was making money . 
 The <unk> on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P N stock-index options was halted Friday . 
 Many market makers in the S&P N index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . 
 Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning . 
 `` They were absolutely killed , <unk> , '' said one Chicago-based options trader . 
 Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose N stocks mimic the Dow industrials , did n't lead yesterday 's big rally . 
 James <unk> , a partner at specialist <unk> & <unk> , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` <unk> Tuesday , '' Oct. N , N -- `` is that then we needed a <unk> to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ N million and get the program rally started . 
 This time { institutions } saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away . 
 Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a <unk> . '' 
 However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of <unk> Tuesday . 
 `` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said Donald <unk> , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . 
 Although the Big Board 's specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday 's <unk> chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them . 
 <unk> were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the Friday plunge . 
 But yesterday , even with <unk> in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected ( the <unk> ) and it was n't too bad , '' said Donaldson 's Mr. <unk> , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on Friday . 
 According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading <unk> in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and <unk> Energy . 
 Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index . 
 No sector of the market has been <unk> during the past two days ' gyrations . 
 Yet from the Dow industrials ' high on Oct. N through Friday 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks . 
 And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues . 
 For example , <unk> jumped N N to N , <unk> rose N N to N N and Baker Hughes rose N N to N . 
 Because of the UAL and AMR <unk> , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday . 
 Philip Morris was the Big Board 's most active issue , rising N N to N N on nearly eight million shares . 
 Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up N at N N on N million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose N N to N on nearly N million shares . 
 Shares of International Business Machines , which reported earnings yesterday , finished at N , up N , after slipping below N during Friday 's session for the first time in five years . 
 Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings . 
 Merrill Lynch added N N to N , PaineWebber rose N to N N and Bear Stearns rose N to N N . 
 Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed N to N on nearly N million shares . 
 At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board 's Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel . 
 Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months . 
 Some N million of the more than N million shares traded in the final N minutes of Friday 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were <unk> , he said . 
 Program trades make up N % of the exchange 's volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say <unk> the market decline , '' Mr. Phelan said . 
 Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday . 
 `` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said . 
 He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants behaved very , very <unk> today . '' 
 Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors . 
 `` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview . 
 `` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. N . 
 They used their judgment . 
 They did n't panic during the first round of selling this morning . 
 Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly . 
 Maybe they learned from experience . '' 
 Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was <unk> , because out of N Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close . 
 `` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. Phelan said of the specialists . 
 Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading <unk> .

 The <unk> <unk> wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today 's scheduled <unk> long enough for them to ask the World Court to `` order '' a permanent <unk> of the $ N billion flight . 
 A <unk> appeals panel yesterday refused to comply , though liberal Judge Pat <unk> went out of her way to deny that this was a `` <unk> '' case . 
 Of course it was . 
 NASA should now sue for fines against all three <unk> , foreign and domestic , for bringing this <unk> case . 
 A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the <unk> U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii . 
 The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less . 
 The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a <unk> <unk> for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years . 
 By a N margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights . 
 But the <unk> compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions . 
 As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast . 
 Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank <unk> ( D. , N.J. ) , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to <unk> votes for the initiative . 
 The measure is attached to the more than $ N billion fiscal N transportation bill within Mr. <unk> 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is <unk> with more than $ N million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver . 
 From the outset , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . 
 But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina . 
 Majority <unk> William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . 
 Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of <unk> lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . 
 In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor . 
 `` <unk> can vote as they want , '' said Rep. William Lehman ( D. , Fla. ) , head of the House conferees . 
 `` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . '' 
 Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than N % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ N billion -- a N % boost . 
 The facilities account includes $ N million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental . 
 <unk> of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver . 
 Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying . 
 The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for N % of the <unk> . 
 But this was rejected in favor of much <unk> language <unk> the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ N billion . 
 Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ N million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports . 
 The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of <unk> airports would be cut by N under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy . 
 Congress previously cut six airports this year . 
 The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ N for each passenger in subsidies . 
 Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ N million for <unk> , including $ N million for capital improvements . 
 And <unk> grants for mass <unk> would be effectively frozen at $ N billion , or $ N million more than last fiscal year . 
 <unk> several <unk> movie hits including `` Batman , '' Los Angeles-based Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. reported earnings for the first quarter ended Aug. N of $ N million , or N cents a share , compared with a year-earlier loss . 
 Sony Corp. , which has offered to acquire the <unk> company , is seeking to free its top executives , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. 's Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc . 
 Sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire Columbia for $ N billion , or $ N a share . 
 Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week ; Sony and Guber-Peters have <unk> , charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony 's acquisition of the two companies . 
 Guber-Peters 's net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ N million , or N cents a share , in the year-earlier period . 
 The company said revenue rose N % , to $ N million from $ N million , reflecting the success of its movies `` <unk> in the <unk> '' and `` <unk> , '' as well as the <unk> <unk> `` Batman . 
 A group including Jon M. <unk> of <unk> Lake City , said it boosted its stake in <unk> Chemical Corp. to N % of the the common shares outstanding . 
 As previously reported , <unk> Holdings Corp. , owned by Jon M. <unk> and other members of his family , proposed that <unk> Corp. , an affiliate of <unk> Holdings , acquire <unk> in a friendly transaction for $ N in cash , or $ N million . 
 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the <unk> group said it controls N <unk> common shares , including N shares bought from Aug. N to Oct. N for $ N to $ N per share . 
 Officials at <unk> , based in Pittsburgh , declined comment . 
 Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a <unk> package . 
 Last month , the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature , the <unk> , in democratic procedures . 
 Senator Pete <unk> calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . '' 
 The Poles might do better to view it as a <unk> <unk> . 
 It is the vast shadow government of N congressional staffers that helps create such legislative <unk> as the N page , N reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States . 
 Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles , they 'd be willing to come back and do the same for the American people . 
 <unk> <unk> PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine <unk> and <unk> <unk> , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to N million Irish punts ( $ N million ) from N million Irish punts a year earlier .

 <unk> has decided against paying an interim dividend . 
 <unk> said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company 's long-term prospects . 
 The sudden `` flight to quality '' that triggered Friday 's <unk> <unk> rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality '' rout . 
 The setback , in which Treasury bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking . 
 `` It was a pretty wild day . 
 Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , '' said Joel <unk> , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . 
 `` Friday 's flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its <unk> , '' he said . 
 Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly N drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday . 
 That caused investors to flee stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities . 
 But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of Treasury bonds declined . 
 <unk> to the selling pressure were <unk> by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios . 
 Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc . 
 The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to <unk> as low as N N % . 
 The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about N N % last week , down from its perceived target level of about N % . 
 The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy . 
 Traders said yesterday 's modest easing did n't stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected . 
 In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week . 
 Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing . 
 The Treasury 's benchmark N bond , ended about N N points lower , or down about $ N for each $ N face amount . 
 The reversal was even more evident among <unk> Treasury securities . 
 After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as N percentage point on Friday , they gave back <unk> of that amount yesterday . 
 The <unk> yield on three-month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at N % , compared with N % Friday . 
 Investment-grade corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell . 
 But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session . 
 Junk bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed . 
 Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying . 
 In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels . 
 `` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , '' said John <unk> , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . 
 U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan , which opened at about N p.m. EDT . 
 The benchmark N bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick N drop in the Tokyo stock market . 
 But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher . 
 Many U.S. trading operations , wanting to keep a <unk> eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin , were fully <unk> during the Tokyo trading session . 
 `` Most of the action was during the night session , '' said Michael Moore , trading manager at Continental Bank . 
 Jay <unk> , who often trades overnight for Capital <unk> Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said trading in Tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile . 
 `` We went down N point in N minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up N point in N minutes , '' he said .

 Industrial production is expected to have declined N % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report . 
 The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ N billion from $ N billion in July . 
 A widening of that magnitude , said one New York trader , is `` not a favorable number ... . 
 It could do damage to us . '' 
 Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $ N billion offering of one-year , three-year , five-year and N maturities . 
 Tomorrow , the Resolution Funding Corp. will provide details of its first bond issue , which is expected to total between $ N billion and $ N billion and carry a maturity greater than N years .

 The spokesman said Laidlaw would n't increase its stake in <unk> beyond N % `` without a great deal of thought '' because of British takeover regulations that require a company acquiring more than N % to extend an offer to the rest of the company 's shareholders . 
 <unk> , a security services and auctions company , trades on London 's Stock Exchange .

 <unk> for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n't there then , '' says an <unk> spokesman . 
 The biggest <unk> of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's <unk> division , known in the industry for its premium products . 
 Sales of <unk> 's four <unk> of black-and-white film this year are <unk> growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much . 
 `` We hope the trend lasts , '' says <unk> <unk> , <unk> 's marketing communications director . 
 Why all the interest ? 
 For baby boomers who grew up being <unk> in color , black and white seems <unk> and exotic . 
 `` It has an <unk> , almost <unk> quality to it , '' says Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology . 
 `` You can shift out of reality with black and white , '' he adds . 
 Such features have been especially attractive to professional <unk> and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising . 
 <unk> of black-and-white commercial film jumped N % last year to N million rolls . 
 Consider <unk> Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known <unk> <unk> the retailer 's jeans and <unk> . 
 Richard <unk> , the account manager for the campaign , says <unk> did n't intentionally choose black and white to distinguish its ads from the color spreads of competitors . 
 `` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , '' he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . '' 
 The campaign won a <unk> award as this year 's best ad by a specialty retailer . 
 Even food products and automobiles , which have long <unk> on color , are making the switch . 
 Companies `` feel black and white will <unk> a stronger statement , '' says Marc L. <unk> , a Chicago <unk> who is working on a black-and-white print ad for <unk> Food Corp. 's <unk> <unk> . 
 Other companies that are currently using <unk> ads include American Express Co. and <unk> America Inc . 
 <unk> studios have also <unk> onto the trend . 
 Using black and white , `` we can make <unk> look like stars , '' says John <unk> . 
 His <unk> <unk> studio in Portland , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is <unk> solid for the next five . 
 One customer , <unk> <unk> , says she <unk> a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic . 
 I show it to my friends , and they all say ` <unk> . ' 
 It is n't ordinary like color . '' 
 Still , most consumers are n't <unk> black-and-white film into their cameras to take family <unk> . 
 One big obstacle is that few <unk> develop the film anymore . 
 Typically , it must be <unk> to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned . 
 <unk> film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same . 
 But for <unk> , developing costs for black-and-white film are higher . 
 Some companies are starting to tackle that problem . 
 <unk> , for example , recently introduced a black-and-white film that can be processed quickly by color labs . 
 <unk> on wooing customers , the company is also increasing its <unk> of black-and-white photography classes . 
 Similarly , <unk> is <unk> scores of photography <unk> at high schools and colleges , offering free black-and-white film and paper as prizes . 
 And Kodak is <unk> an <unk> video to processors on how to develop its <unk> film more efficiently . 
 Other companies are introducing related products . 
 Charles <unk> Co. , a leading maker of photographic <unk> , introduced last month a complete <unk> <unk> <unk> targeted at <unk> who want to process their own black-and-white <unk> . 
 The <unk> , which has a suggested retail price of $ N and has already become a <unk> , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment . 
 `` It seems computers as <unk> have <unk> , '' says <unk> <unk> , <unk> 's chairman and chief executive officer . 
 But some industry observers believe the <unk> of black and white is only a <unk> . 
 They cite the emergence of still electronic photography , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and <unk> improvements in the quality of color <unk> . 
 `` Black and white has n't made the same <unk> <unk> in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute . 
 `` The color print today is far superior to <unk> of N years ago . 
 You ca n't say the same with black and white . '' 
 But when Popular <unk> , a leading magazine for <unk> , selected N of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's N anniversary , all were black and white . 
 `` It 's got a classic spirit and carries over <unk> , '' says Alfred <unk> of Professional <unk> of America . 
 `` That 's the appeal .

 The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .

 <unk> S.p . A. and Societe National <unk> <unk> , the state oil companies of Italy and France , respectively , submitted an offer to buy <unk> Suisse S.A . 
 The price was n't disclosed . 
 A spokesman for <unk> said that the Swiss oil concern was <unk> the offer , submitted last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted last week . 
 Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies . 
 The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks . 
 <unk> Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of N barrels a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets . 
 While Friday 's plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy 's prospects , a <unk> indicator that has <unk> <unk> the economy 's <unk> and <unk> by <unk> long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity . 
 The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business <unk> Research here , reached a record high of N in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then . 
 The latest reading of N was up from N in July and N as recently as March . 
 The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the N average as a base of N . 
 In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year . 
 Its <unk> behavior through much of N has prompted some <unk> to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end . 
 But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says <unk> H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility . 
 A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business <unk> <unk> Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when <unk> and recessions begin and end . 
 The group normally <unk> only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely . 
 `` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , '' Mr. Moore reports . 
 Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee <unk> economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well . 
 They expect a N % rise in N in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation . 
 <unk> this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or <unk> , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators . 
 Over the full <unk> War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines N months before the <unk> of recessions and turned up eight months before <unk> . 
 The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- N months before recessions and only three months before <unk> . 
 The Columbia economists also have <unk> how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in N , before the stock market crash in October that <unk> in the Great Depression . 
 The indicator reached a peak in January N and then fell steadily up to and through the crash . 
 `` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says . 
 A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate <unk> index , which is not a part of the Commerce index . 
 In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early N . 
 It also rose last Friday , while the stock market <unk> . 
 Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the N version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new <unk> permits . 
 <unk> <unk> from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's <unk> prospects , though it still is useful for anticipating some <unk> <unk> and turns . '' 
 As recently as N , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of N common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the N leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index . 
 It was assigned a mark of N out of a possible N , compared with scores ranging as low as N for the other components . 
 The stock market has lost some <unk> power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments . 
 `` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the <unk> balance and inflows of foreign capital . 
 He also feels that the rise of such <unk> practices as program trading has diminished the stock market 's <unk> to the economic outlook . 
 BSN S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire <unk> G.m.b . H. , a West German pasta maker .

 The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to N from N and for preferred stock to <unk> from <unk> .

 An American journalist now is standing trial in Namibia . 
 This is the place that world opinion has been celebrating over in the expectation that it 's going to hold an election . 
 The most likely winner will be the <unk> <unk> rebels . 
 The U.S. journalist 's `` crime '' was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness , <unk> <unk> , was openly sympathetic to <unk> . 
 Shortly after that , Mr. <unk> had Scott Stanley arrested and his <unk> confiscated . 
 Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a <unk> , issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which made it a crime punishable by two years in prison for any person to `` <unk> , <unk> or <unk> '' the election commission . 
 The Stanley affair does n't <unk> well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in Namibia when <unk> starts running the government . 
 To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the <unk> guerrillas were above all else the victims of <unk> by neighboring South Africa .

 Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday . 
 Yesterday , the stock market 's influence at first created nervousness . 
 Later , however , it became more of an <unk> than a <unk> force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors . 
 Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its <unk> <unk> with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered . 
 Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy . 
 Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved . 
 Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss . 
 Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines . 
 In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly . 
 <unk> and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork . 
 In commodity markets yesterday : <unk> <unk> : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved <unk> , first falling and then later rising . 
 Silver performed quietly . 
 The spot October gold price rose $ N to $ N an ounce . 
 The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ N an ounce at $ N , after trading as high as $ N . 
 December silver was up N cents an ounce at $ N . 
 <unk> behaved more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened . 
 Gold was <unk> the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday . 
 For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its <unk> nose dive , so it could n't react to it . 
 Back on Friday , Oct. N , N , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell . 
 The October N contract that day rose as much as $ N to as high as $ N , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March N , rose as much as $ N . 
 On Black Monday , Oct. N , N , the October contract tacked on further gains , rising to as high as $ N for a gain of almost $ N on top of the Friday advances , before giving up almost $ N of that at the close . 
 Yesterday 's October gain of $ N was <unk> compared with that . 
 One analyst , Peter <unk> of <unk> & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good <unk> technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market . 
 `` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , '' said Mr. <unk> . 
 There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said . 
 He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising . 
 Finally , according to Mr. <unk> , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today . 
 This would be damaging to the dollar and supportive for gold , he said . 
 ENERGY : 
 <unk> that Friday 's N stock market plunge might be a <unk> of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices . 
 The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ N a barrel for November delivery , down N cents . 
 Some analysts said crude was due for a correction <unk> , following several days of significant gains . 
 But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what <unk> spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday . 
 Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong . 
 The Organization of Petroleum <unk> <unk> increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand . 
 So any bearish indicator , such as Friday 's <unk> drop in the stock market , sends <unk> through the oil markets as well . 
 Indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to Friday 's plummet , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market 's partial recovery yesterday . 
 <unk> : 
 Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been <unk> prices appeared to be solved . 
 The December contract declined N cents a pound to $ N . 
 Prices were down from the outset of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a <unk> reduction in copper use . 
 But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst . 
 Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories <unk> . 
 Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company . 
 Now , the analyst said , only minor points remain to be <unk> up . 
 `` For all <unk> and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , '' he said . 
 Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange <unk> rose yesterday by N tons , to N tons . 
 London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined N tons , to N tons . 
 The <unk> stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n't . 
 However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said . 
 At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ N , but it was n't able to sustain the gain . 
 `` It was simply <unk> , '' he said , and selling by funds that are computer <unk> helped depress prices . 
 <unk> : 
 Futures prices eased , more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market . 
 The December contract ended with a loss of N cent a pound , at N cents . 
 Technical considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities , New York . 
 Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which is part of the Mississippi Delta <unk> area . 
 However , after <unk> the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said .

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at N , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying N plunge as a sharp correction , not a <unk> . 
 Many went bargain-hunting . 
 Among those <unk> with relief was John H. Gutfreund , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events . 
 As the rally gained strength at N p.m. , he <unk> broadly , <unk> his <unk> <unk> and <unk> Stanley <unk> , his top stock trader , on the back . 
 At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . 
 As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers . 
 By N , the Dow <unk> were off N points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened .

 It ended with a gain of N points . 
 By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than N million , the fourth highest on record . 
 The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of N .

 Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained .

 Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the N crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge <unk> or <unk> in a few hours ' time must be expected . 
 What 's more , such short-term <unk> are <unk> and are no cause for panic selling . 
 Stephen Boesel , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in N : We had been through it once . '' 
 In <unk> , Wis. , <unk> <unk> , who owns a supplier of <unk> equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees . 
 `` I look at it as a <unk> matter , '' he says . 
 Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback . 
 The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day . 
 Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts . 
 The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to N yen , bounced back strongly to N , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks . 
 And the widely <unk> opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped calm investors . 
 Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday . 
 Still , amid all the <unk> and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's .

 `` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton . 
 Shearson 's London trading room went wild . 
 Traders shouted out as their <unk> , Quotron and Telerate screens posted an <unk> loss on Wall Street . 
 Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . 
 `` Rally , rally , rally , '' shouted Shearson 's <unk> Rosen . 
 `` This is panic buying . '' 
 Major blue-chip stocks like Philip Morris , General Motors and <unk> & Gamble led the rally . 
 Japanese were said to be heavy buyers . 
 German and Dutch investors reportedly <unk> up on Kellogg Co . 
 Then , traders say , corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear , triggering gains in , among other issues , <unk> <unk> and McDonald 's .

 By N , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting <unk> on trading desks and exchange floors . 
 Among Big Board specialists , the cry was `` <unk> your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .

 `` What we had was a real , old-fashioned rally . '' 
 This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods . 
 Typical , perhaps , was <unk> 's Dean <unk> . 
 Mr. <unk> , who manages $ N billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was <unk> to do . '' 
 Asked what stocks the computer bought , the money manager says , `` I do n't know . '' 
 Not everybody was making money . 
 The <unk> on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P N stock-index options was halted Friday .

 Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .

 Britain 's Blue Arrow PLC intends to change its name to Manpower PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ N billion in good will realized in the takeover of <unk> Manpower Inc . 
 Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to <unk> the world 's biggest <unk> group in the U.S. . 
 Mr. Fromstein disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few months , as Blue Arrow posted a N % drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings . 
 The name change and good will write-off could help <unk> Blue Arrow 's dominance of the U.S. <unk> market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday 's market plunge . 
 U.S. holders now own more than N % of Blue Arrow compared with N % last January . 
 `` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the Manpower name is <unk> stronger than Blue Arrow , '' Mr. Fromstein said . 
 The moves also could <unk> shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil . 
 `` It further <unk> the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York . 
 The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , '' he added . 
 In a widely publicized <unk> coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted <unk> Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $ N <unk> chief of <unk> Manpower . 
 Mr. Fromstein <unk> his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman . 
 But the Blue Arrow <unk> is n't over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # N million ( $ N million ) loan which Mr. Fromstein has said was made under Mr. Berry 's direction . 
 Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ N billion takeover of Manpower in N largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies . 
 Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ N billion in good will <unk> from the purchase . 
 As a <unk> company , Blue Arrow would have to <unk> the good will over as many as N years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings . 
 Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets . 
 But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . 
 `` Our balance sheets look like they came from <unk> 's <unk> , '' Mr. Fromstein said . 
 The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth '' following the N write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ N billion of net worth because almost none of { the good will } has been written off . '' 
 Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to <unk> some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell <unk> , but would n't specify how much . 
 People close to Blue Arrow suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management <unk> the extent of Manpower 's good will . 
 That move , along with the return to the Manpower name , could bolster the company 's prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help . 
 The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about N % in the N months ending Aug. N , after sliding nearly N % in July , said Kidder Peabody 's Mr. Arthur . 
 Blue Arrow blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July N partly on slower earnings growth of <unk> units in Britain . 
 Overall , pretax profit slid to # N million in the quarter from # N million a year earlier . 
 Richard G. Sim , the man credited with <unk> Applied Power Inc. from an <unk> into a <unk> player in the global market for <unk> tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company 's latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp . 
 The N former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time . 
 But analysts , while <unk> the acquisition , say Applied 's chief executive faces a tough challenge in <unk> the two companies . 
 Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ N million , makes <unk> equipment and <unk> systems . 
 The <unk> , Mass. , company 's sales have been <unk> and its profits have dropped . 
 Last year 's earnings of $ N million , including $ N from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ N million . 
 Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ N million in N , Mr. Sim must <unk> its costs and product line . 
 `` The question is how long it 's going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution , '' says F. John <unk> , an analyst at <unk> Ellis <unk> in Milwaukee . 
 The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim . 
 The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ N a share in August N , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ N per-share price by N . 
 Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August N . 
 The stock has since <unk> , trading around $ N a share last week and closing yesterday at $ N in national over-the-counter trading . 
 But Mr. Sim has set a fresh target of $ N a share by the end of 
 <unk> that goal , says Robert T. <unk> , Applied 's chief financial officer , will require `` efficient reinvestment '' of cash by Applied and <unk> of its healthy N % rate of return on operating capital . 
 In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in N . 
 Applied , then a closely held company , was <unk> under the management of its controlling family . 
 While profitable , it `` was n't growing and was n't providing a satisfactory return on invested capital , '' he says . 
 Mr. Sim is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied . 
 He also <unk> an `` <unk> '' <unk> to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where <unk> is shared . 
 Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors . 
 `` With a little patience , these businesses will perform very <unk> , '' Mr. Sim says . 
 Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , '' he predicts . 
 Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat . 
 When he came to Applied , `` I did n't have the power to execute as I do today , '' he says . 
 He was named chief executive officer of Applied in N and became chairman last November . 
 At Applied , Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective . 
 He took the company public in an offering that <unk> Applied about $ N million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program . 
 Sales climbed to an estimated $ N million in fiscal N , ended Aug. N , from $ N million in fiscal N . 
 The company expects that earnings , which have marched steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ N million , or $ N a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ N million in fiscal N and $ N million in N .
